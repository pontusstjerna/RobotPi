# RobotPi
The software used for my robot built with a RaspberryPi.

Also known as the cat hunter, the RobotPi is a robot I built from scratch. I bought a chassis, a Raspberry Pi and a voltage regulator, back when I studied computer science around 2015. The project is still ongoing and I still use the same RaspberryPi.

Many parts of the robot has been completely rebuild and printed with a 3D-printer. The size is now about 1/4 of its original. The original Nimh battery is replaced by a small 1S LiPo with an onboard charger. When there is time, I might upload some videos/pics of it.

Software is plain Python, using OpenCV for video. MQTT is used as protol for all control/communication.
